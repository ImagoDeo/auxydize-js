## UNDER CONSTRUCTION

TODO:

- Readme
- Some kind of bundling/compile for bin install?
- Todos in files
  - edit command
- Unit tests
  - Not exhaustive. Lean.
- Add confirmation step for decrypting the database
- Add confirmation step for removing a secret
- Improve issuer handling
  - Since only issuer:name is unique, all the --name opts have to be updated.
  - Show issuer and name for ls
  - For operations meant to do something with only one secret, throw errors when more than one is returned
